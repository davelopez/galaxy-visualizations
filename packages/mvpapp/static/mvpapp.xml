# What is the MVP Application?

The Galaxy-based **MVP visualization plugin** enables viewing of results produced from workflows integrating genomic sequencing data and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data, commonly known as **proteogenomics**.

This multi-functional tool provides:

- Organization and filtering of results
- Quality assessment of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data matched to peptide sequences
- Visualization of data at both the **protein** and **gene** level

With relatively few keystrokes, users can filter and order large datasets down to a manageable subset.
