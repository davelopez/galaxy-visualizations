# What is the MVP Application?

The Galaxy-based **MVP (Multi-omics Visualization Platform)** plugin enables interactive exploration of results produced from workflows integrating genomic sequencing data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics dataâ€”an approach commonly referred to as **proteogenomics**.

MVP is a multi-functional visualization tool designed to:

- Organize and filter large, complex datasets
- Assess the quality of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data matched to peptide sequences
- Visualize data at both the **protein** and **gene** levels

With a user-friendly interface, researchers can filter and sort through large datasets with just a few keystrokes to isolate relevant findings.
